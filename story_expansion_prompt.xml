  There is an “I’m Just Ken” event happening, but I’m driving my car to the venue.  
There are lots of cars going to the event as well.

I turn into the parking lot, drive into the venue, and notice fewer cars inside compared to outside.  
I park my car and start to walk.

There are lots of people in the venue—lots of parents and kids.   
I also see Mark Carney at the event. I introduce myself and tell him I am in his cabinet.  
He asks me, “I am worried about the upcoming Seb losses.” I reply, “Yes.”  

I start to make my way out of the venue.

There are lots of people trying to get in. The “I’m Just Ken” song is playing.  
I am singing as I leave, and I notice people singing it as well.
