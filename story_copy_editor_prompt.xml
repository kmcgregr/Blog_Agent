**Title: The Unchanging Distance**

### **I. The Familiar Chaos**  

The fluorescent lights of Toys R Us buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the chaos below. Elias adjusted the straps of his backpack, the weight of it a familiar burden. Beside him, Denise tugged at the sleeve of her coat, her breath visible in the frigid air that seeped through the store’s glass doors. They had been here before—dozens of times, in fact—on errands, on dates, on days when the world felt too heavy to bear. This was one of those days.  

Their destination was clear: a small, plastic dinosaur for their niece’s birthday. It was the kind of task that required no thought, no effort—just a trip to the store, a few minutes of browsing, and a transaction that would be forgotten by the time they got home. Yet, as they stepped into the labyrinth of aisles, Elias couldn’t shake the feeling that the store had grown larger since their last visit. The aisles stretched endlessly, the shelves groaning under the weight of toys that seemed to multiply with every step.  

Denise laughed as she ducked under a banner advertising “Back to School Sale,” her voice carrying over the din of children’s laughter and the whir of a toy train circling a display. “Remember when we used to come here just for fun?” she asked, her eyes twinkling.  

Elias smiled, though his heart felt distant. “Yeah. Back when we didn’t have a niece.”  

Denise’s laughter softened. “You’re right. It’s been a while.”  

They moved through the store, their footsteps muffled by the thick carpeting. The air was thick with the scent of plastic, glue, and something faintly sweet—like the remnants of a forgotten candy factory. Elias glanced at Denise, noting the way her hands fluttered as she examined a display of plush animals. She still had the same energy, the same way of making even the most mundane tasks feel like an adventure. It was one of the things he loved about her.  

But there was something else, too—a weariness that had crept into their marriage like ivy through a crack in the wall. It wasn’t dramatic, not like the fights they’d had in their early years, but it was there, in the way they passed each other in the hallway without speaking, in the way they both reached for the same side of the bed when they woke up, in the way their conversations had become more about logistics than love.  

Denise paused at a display of baby cribs, her fingers brushing against the smooth plastic. “We should check if they do price matching,” she said, turning to Elias. “I mean, if we can get it cheaper at another store, we should.”  

Elias nodded, though he didn’t see the point. “Sure. Let’s go.”  

As they turned, the gap between them widened slightly. It was nothing—just a few steps, the kind of distance that existed naturally in a crowd. But as Elias walked ahead, something in him prickled with unease. The line ahead of them was long, the people in front of them moving slowly, their conversations blending into the background noise.  

He glanced at Denise, who was now several feet behind him, her back turned as she examined a row of educational toys. For a moment, he felt the weight of the distance between them—not just the physical gap, but the invisible one that had been growing for years.  

He shook his head, dismissing the thought. It was just a store. A trip. A task.  

But as he moved forward, something strange happened. The gap between him and Denise didn’t shrink.

### **II. The Question and the Queue**  

Denise’s voice cut through the noise of the store. “Elias, are you checking the price matching?”  

Elias turned, his eyes scanning the line ahead of them. The people in front of them were moving slowly, their conversations punctuated by the occasional giggle or sigh. He could see the cashier at the end of the line, a woman with a nametag that read *“Samantha”* and a face that looked like she’d rather be anywhere else.  

“I’ll be right back,” he said, his voice a little too loud in the cavernous space.  

Denise nodded, her expression unreadable. “Just don’t take too long.”  

He moved forward, the gap between him and Denise stretching as he walked. It was a normal distance, nothing unusual. People in line always kept a certain amount of space between them. But as he took another step, something about the way the space remained constant unsettled him.  

It wasn’t the first time he’d felt like this. There had been other moments—small, fleeting—when the world felt a little too still, when the air seemed to press against his skin like a second layer. But those moments had always passed, like clouds drifting across the sky. This, however, felt different.  

He reached the cashier’s counter, the woman named Samantha looking up with a tired smile. “Can I help you?”  

“I was wondering,” Elias began, “does Toys R Us do price matching?”  

Samantha blinked, her eyes flicking to the line behind him. “Yes,” she said slowly, “but we only do it for items that are currently in stock. If you have a receipt from another store, we can check.”  

Elias nodded, but his mind was already elsewhere. He could feel the distance between him and Denise again, though he couldn’t see her. The line ahead of him was moving, the people ahead of him stepping forward, their bodies inching closer to the cashier. And yet, the space between Elias and Denise remained unchanged.  

He turned, his eyes searching for her. She was still there, several feet behind him, her back to him as she examined a row of stuffed animals. She looked normal, like nothing was wrong.  

But something was wrong.  

The gap between them wasn’t shrinking.

### **III. The Repeating Space**  

Elias took a step forward, his boots thudding against the polished floor. The line ahead of him moved, the people in front of him stepping closer to the cashier. But the space between him and Denise remained the same.  

He blinked, his vision slightly blurred. Had he imagined it? It was possible. The store was loud, the air was thick, and his mind was tired. Maybe he was just tired.  

But then he took another step, and the gap remained.  

A cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He turned again, his eyes locking onto Denise. She was still there, still examining the stuffed animals, still completely unaware of what was happening.  

He opened his mouth to call her name, but no sound came out.  

A flicker of panic surged through him. He took another step forward, and the gap didn’t change. The people in front of him were moving, their bodies inching closer to the cashier. But the space between Elias and Denise remained unyielding, a void that refused to be filled.  

He felt his heart race, his breath coming in shallow gasps. This wasn’t normal. It wasn’t possible.  

He turned back to the cashier, his voice cracking as he spoke. “Does this happen often?”  

Samantha looked at him, her expression puzzled. “What?”  

“The gap,” he said. “Between people in line. Does it stay the same?”  

Samantha blinked, her eyes flicking to the line behind him. “No,” she said slowly. “It never stays the same.”  

Elias stared at her, his mind reeling. The gap between him and Denise had to be changing. It had to be. But it wasn’t.  

He turned again, his eyes locking onto Denise. She was still there, her back to him, her hands brushing against a stuffed bear. He could see her, but he couldn’t reach her.  

And then, for the first time, he felt the distance between them not as a physical space, but as something deeper—something that had been growing for years, something that had been there all along, waiting for him to notice.  

He took another step forward, and the gap remained.

### **IV. The Bookcase Guardians**  

Elias’s eyes flicked to the bookcases that flanked the line, towering over them like silent sentinels. They were enormous, their shelves packed with books that seemed to stretch into infinity. The spines of the books were faded, their titles worn down by time, and yet they stood there, unmoving, as if guarding something important.  

He had never noticed them before. Not really. They had always been there, part of the background, part of the chaos. But now, as he stood in the line, they seemed to loom over him, their presence oppressive.  

The books on the shelves were not just books. They were memories. They were the stories of people who had come before, people who had walked these aisles, people who had stood in lines like this, people who had felt the same weight of distance that he felt now.  

He felt a strange compulsion to look at the books, to see what stories they held. But as he turned his head, the books seemed to shift, their spines rearranging themselves in a way that was impossible.  

He blinked, his vision swimming. The books were still there, but now they seemed to be watching him.  

A shiver ran down his spine.  

He turned back to the line, his eyes locking onto Denise. She was still there, still examining the stuffed animals, still unaware of the books that seemed to be watching them.  

But the books were not the only thing that seemed to be watching.  

The people in the line behind him were moving, their bodies inching closer to the cashier. But they weren’t moving in a natural way. Their steps were slow, deliberate, as if they were being guided by something unseen.  

And then, as he looked down at the floor, he saw it.  

The gap between him and Denise was still there, still unyielding.  

But now, the floor beneath him was marked with lines—lines that stretched from the bookcases to the cashier’s counter, lines that seemed to form a path that connected everything.  

Elias felt his breath catch in his throat.  

The books were not just guardians. They were guides.  

And the line was not just a line. It was a test.  

He took another step forward, and the gap between him and Denise remained.  

But now, he could feel the weight of the books pressing against him, their presence a constant reminder that something was wrong.  

He could feel the distance between him and Denise, not just as a physical space, but as something deeper.  

Something that had been growing for years.  

Something that had been waiting for him to notice.  

And now, it was too late.

### **V. The Distance**  

Elias took another step forward, his boots thudding against the polished floor. The people in the line ahead of him were moving, their bodies inching closer to the cashier. But the gap between him and Denise remained unchanged.  

He turned again, his eyes locking onto Denise. She was still there, still examining the stuffed animals, still completely unaware of what was happening.  

He could see her, but he couldn’t reach her.

### **VI. The Choice**  

Elias stood frozen, his eyes locked onto Denise. The gap between them remained, unyielding. The books on the shelves seemed to shift again, their spines rearranging themselves in a way that was impossible.  

He felt a strange compulsion to move closer to her, to bridge the gap that had been growing for years. But as he took a step forward, the floor beneath him seemed to resist, as if the line itself was holding him back.  

He turned to the cashier, his voice cracking as he spoke. “Does this happen often?”  

Samantha looked at him, her expression puzzled. “What?”  

“The gap,” he said. “Between people in line. Does it stay the same?”  

Samantha blinked, her eyes flicking to the line behind him. “No,” she said slowly. “It never stays the same.”  

Elias stared at her, his mind reeling. The gap between him and Denise had to be changing. It had to be. But it wasn’t.  

He turned again, his eyes locking onto Denise. She was still there, still examining the stuffed animals, still completely unaware of what was happening.  

But now, he could see her more clearly. He could see the weariness in her eyes, the same weariness that had been growing in their marriage for years.  

He could see the distance between them not as a physical space, but as something deeper.  

Something that had been waiting for him to notice.  

And now, it was too late.  

He took another step forward, and the gap remained.  

But now, he could feel the weight of the books pressing against him, their presence a constant reminder that something was wrong.
