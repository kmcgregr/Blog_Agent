Here is the refined dream entry:

My wife asks me, "How long is the drive to North Carolina?" Google Maps tells me it will take 8 hours and 9 minutes.

I then start my dream trip to North Carolina alone. At the halfway point, I stop to get gas.
I finally arrive at a place in North Carolina. There are a lot of people there who seem to be attending a conference. I meet some folks and hang out with them. Some of them disappear, and I can't find them again.

As I'm exploring, I come across one of my high school friends, and we hang out together. He's also visiting North Carolina.

It's now time for me to go home. I ask my friend what time he is leaving, and he says 5 o'clock. I say my goodbyes to the others and head back to my car... and I wake up.
