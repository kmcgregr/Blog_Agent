I am on a bus with co-workers. When I notice one is missing, I asked my colleague where he is. He doesn't know. I went to the seat where my missing colleague was supposed to sit, and I see a lady and I asked here about
my missing colleague. She does not know what happened. I  transition to me writing a
story about my missing co-worker.
I transition to a futuristic setting. 
I am waiting for a bus with co-workers. One of the potential passengers is Kerry 
Washington. I get the sense that she is in danger. 
A futuristic bus arrives,and we get in. 
Someone else gets and starts to engage Kerry
Washington in a laser  gun fight.
I also engage in the last gun fight, shooting at the person 
attacking Kerry Washington. I manage to shoot the attacker 
but he digs a hole and escapes.
