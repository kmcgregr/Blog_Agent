My co-workers and I
are on some quest
to find some sort
of treasure.
We are on our
way to Vancouver
First, we take a
train. The train
stops and the
conductor tells
us we have
reached our
journey.
We depart the
bus and we
are walking
in Downtown
Vancouver.
We come across
a man who pulls
out a knife. There
is a fight and
my co-workers and
I are able to
overcome the man
with the knife.
We finally reach
a restaurant/cafe
where we start
to leave when
a mysterious man
and woman
ask me a question
I answered and they say
I am the person
they are looking for.
I sit down with
them and they
sign over legal
ownership to me
for Lamborghini,
houses and lots
of cash. There
are lots of bags
and documents
I have to ask
my colleagues
to help me
carry them.
