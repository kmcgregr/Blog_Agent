Here's a detailed and imaginative text-to-image prompt suitable for an AI art model:

**Title:** "Eternal Cycles"

**Style:** Dark, gritty urban fantasy with a blend of realistic and surreal elements. Think "Blade Runner" meets "The Matrix".

**Key Elements:**

1. **Cityscape**: A sprawling metropolis with towering skyscrapers, neon-lit streets, and a sense of perpetual twilight. The city should appear worn down by years of conflict and decay.
2. **Time Loop**: Depict the protagonist stuck in an endless cycle of reliving the same moments. Show multiple iterations of the loop, with subtle differences between each iteration (e.g., different clothes, posture, or expressions).
3. **Crime Lord's Mansion**: A grand, opulent house surrounded by high walls and guarded by henchmen. The mansion should exude an air of corruption and power.
4. **Helicopter and Cage**: A dramatic moment where the protagonist is securing the cage with the helicopter in the background. Capture the tension and uncertainty as the protagonist is about to be blown up.
5. **Protagonist's Emotional State**: Convey the protagonist's frustration, desperation, and determination through their facial expressions and body language.

**Mood and Atmosphere:**

* Create a sense of claustrophobia and hopelessness, emphasizing the protagonist's inability to escape the time loop.
* Use warm colors (e.g., oranges, yellows) to convey the tension and urgency of the situation.
* Incorporate subtle hints of supernatural or sci-fi elements to hint at the nature of the time loop.

**Composition:**

* Place the protagonist in the center of the composition, surrounded by the cityscape and the crime lord's mansion in the background.
* Use bold lines and dynamic camera angles to capture the energy and movement of the scene.
* Experiment with multiple layers and textures to create a visually striking image.

**Style Inspiration:**

* Draw inspiration from the works of artists like H.R. Giger, Zdzisław Beksiński, or Syd Mead for their dark, futuristic cityscapes and industrial landscapes.
* Incorporate elements of cyberpunk and urban fantasy to create a unique blend of styles.
