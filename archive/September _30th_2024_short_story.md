**Expanded Short Story**

The sun had long since set, casting a warm orange glow over our backyard. My wife and I sat on the porch swing, enjoying the peaceful evening. We were lost in conversation when suddenly, without warning, a raccoon emerged from the bushes. It was followed by an emu, a skunk, and finally, a bear.

My initial reaction was fear. I jumped up, trying to shield my wife with my body. But as I looked into her calm eyes, I knew she wasn't worried. "Leave them alone," she said softly.

I hesitated for a moment before lowering the stick I had grabbed from the porch table. The creatures continued to approach us, their eyes fixed on something behind me. My wife and I exchanged a glance, and I saw a hint of concern in her expression.

The chaos erupted as more creatures arrived: a fox, a deer, and a wild boar. They seemed to be drawn to each other, rather than to my wife or me. But it was the way they moved, almost as if they were being summoned by an unseen force, that unsettled me.

I tried again with the stick, but this time, I was met with resistance. The creatures seemed to sense my intention and swarmed around me, their snouts sniffing out every inch of my body. My wife's voice became distant, urging me to leave them be.

That's when I saw it: a door or portal where there shouldn't have been one. It was hidden behind the bushes, but now that I looked closer, I could see it clearly. The creatures seemed drawn to it as well, and for a moment, we all stood there in stunned silence.

I made the decision to retreat indoors, leaving the menagerie to their mysterious gathering. As I locked myself inside, my wife followed closely behind me. We stood at the kitchen sink, watching through the window as the creatures continued to mill about, drawn to that strange doorway.

"What was it?" I asked, but my voice was barely above a whisper.

My wife's expression remained unreadable. "I don't know," she said finally. "But maybe we should leave them alone."

The silence that followed was oppressive, heavy with unspoken questions and fears. My mind whirled with possibilities: were these creatures fleeing from something? Were they being summoned to something greater?

As the hours ticked by, the stillness deepened, punctuated only by the occasional rustling of leaves or chirping of crickets. I couldn't shake off the feeling that we had stumbled into something much bigger than ourselves.

The memory of that evening stayed with me for weeks, etched in my mind like a scar. And every time I looked at our backyard, I couldn't help but wonder: what was behind that door or portal?
