- I am waiting on a bus with two of my friends to go to target. The finally arrives,when the door opens it is full of university students who come off.
- One of my friends has a bus pass that she uses to get all of us on the bus. We walk through the crowd of university students to find seats. My friends find seats for them selves.
- I sit beside a young child and an older man who appears to be sleeping. The bus departs. The bus ride is long. I try to track the route to target on my phone to see if I am on the right path.
- During the bus ride, I see outside the bus green lantern in a pile of [rocks.it](http://rocks.it) appears he was in battle with a villain.
- I finally see target, my friends look over at me and confirm it is time to get off the bus. The bus stops and we get off.
