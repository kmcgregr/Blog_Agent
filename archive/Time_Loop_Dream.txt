I am stuck in a time loop
The setting is a city that is
occupied by soldiers.
I see a kid heading towards a
house of a crime lord. I follow
him to the crime lords house
The crime lord comes out and shoots
us both.
I wake up from that iteration of
the loop and I try a different
tactic -- this time I hide


in an abandoned building I
can see a group of children
heading to the crime lords house.
The kids are armed. The crime
lord comes out and starts to
run. One of the kids enter
the abandoned building I am
hiding, and I get shot
in the cross fire.
Next iteration.. I run to
a soldier to warn him. He does
not believe me. I started
asking the soldier his mother's
maiden name, where he is
from in order to convince
him in the next loop. Again
I die in this loop.
In the subsequent loop
my tactic works I am able
to convince the soldier
to expectplan a trap

for the crime lord.
This involves catching him
in a cage attached to
a helicopter. The plan works
and we are able to catch him.
However there is something wrong
with the cage. I volunteer to
climb on the rope to secure
the cage.
while I secure it the crime lord
said that I will be blown up
when I pass between two
buildings. Sure enough I
am blown off and... I wake
up.
