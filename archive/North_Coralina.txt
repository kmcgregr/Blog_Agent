My wife asks me the drive how
long is the drive to North Carolina.
Google maps tells me 8 hours &
9 minutes.

I, alone, then start my dream
trip to North Carolina. At the
halfway point, I stop and
get gas.
I finally arrive at a place n N.C. There are a lot of
people there at what seems
to be a conference. I meet
some folks and hang out
with them. Some of them
disappear and I can't
find them again. I
come across one of
my high school friends, I hang
out with him. He is also
visiting N.C.

Now it is time for me
to go home. I asm my friend  what time
he is leaving, he says
5 o'clock. I say my
goodbyes to others
and head to my car
... I wake up.
