There is a Im Just Ken
event happening but I
am driving my car to the
event. There are lots of
cars going to the event
as well.

I turn into
I drove into the venue
and noticed less cars
in the venue compared
to outside the venue.
I park my car and
start to walk.
There are lots of
people in the venue
lots of parents and
kids. It started
to S.
I also see Mike
Corney at the event
I introduced myself
and told him
I am in his cabinet
he asked me 
I am worried about
the upcoming Seb losses.
I told him, "yes".
I start to make my
way out of the venue.

There are lots of
people trying to get
in. The I'm Just Ken
song is playing. I am
singing as I leave.
I notice people singing
it as well.
