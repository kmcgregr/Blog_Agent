my dream last night ...
I am walking home when a strong wind pushes me up in the air and I start to fly. 
I am flying over buildings and fields. I start to descend quickly 
unable to fly upwards. I am about to splash in some houses 
but I miss those and land on the beach. My landing causes 
lots of sand to be dispersed. I look around and 
see that the sand has hit a family, 
they are upset and start to chase me. 
I am running from them. I then then realise I can fly again. 
I jump up and I start to fly. However I can't fly far enough 
because of  electrical wires all over the sky.
The family is still chasing me. Throwing bottles at me. I manage to catch one of the bottles and throw it back. The bottle slows them down. I think I can get away from the family. 
I turn around to see the tall girl who can reach me. She grabs my legs. 

...I wake up
